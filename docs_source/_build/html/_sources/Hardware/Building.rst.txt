Memory Testing
-----------
It is convinient to test the memory on a open benchtable before you build the server.
Use `Memtest86 <https://www.memtest86.com>`_ to diagnose faulty RAM using a series of comprehensive algorithms and test patterns.
Finishing all of the tasks in MemTest86 is required. 
Sometimes, error only occurs in a particular task due to system instability.

- Flash Memtest86 into a bootable USB stick. 
- With USB stick, Start the server.
- test memory

.. caution::

    For stability, you must finish all of the tasks.
